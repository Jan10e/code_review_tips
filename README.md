# Code Review Tips

> I'm talking about improving the code - but programmers love to argue about 
> what good code looks like. (...) If we consider this to be a matter of
> aesthetics, where nothing is either good of bad but thinking makes it so,
> we lack any guide but personal taste. (...) We can go beyond taste and 
> say that <b> the true test of good code is how easy it is to change it! </b>
